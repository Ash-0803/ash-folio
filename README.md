# Portfolio Website â€” v1

My name is Ashish Chaudhary, a FullStack Software Engineer based in India.

ðŸ’¡ "Developer-turned-peopleâ€™s person" â€” I started my career building and fixing things behind the screen, from optimizing websites for lightning-fast performance to untangling database spaghetti. Now, Iâ€™m taking that same problem-solving mindset and moving into the client-facing world of LegalTech Sales.

I love translating tech jargon into plain English, helping teams make smarter decisions, and turning complex ideas into simple wins. Competitive by nature, curious by default, and always up for a challenge â€” whether itâ€™s closing a deal, explaining CLS to a non-techie, or finding the best coffee in town.
